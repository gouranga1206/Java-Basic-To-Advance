# Understanding the `main` Method in Java

The `main` method is the entry point of any Java application. Here’s a breakdown of its components and purpose:

1. **`public`**  
   - This is an **access specifier** that makes the `main` method accessible from anywhere.
   - It allows the JVM to invoke the method from outside the class.

2. **`static`**  
   - The `main` method must be called **without creating an object**, which is why it’s declared static.
   - You can write the modifiers `public` and `static` in either order.

3. **`void`**  
   - The return type of `main` is `void` because it **doesn’t return any value** to the caller.

4. **`main()`**  
   - This is the **method name** specifically recognized by the JVM as the entry point for execution.

5. **`String[] args`**  
   - This parameter represents the **command-line arguments** passed to the program.
   - It allows users to pass arguments to the application during runtime.

6. **`main(String[] args)`**  
   - This combination of method name and parameter type is the **method signature** that the JVM looks for to start the program.

### The `main` Thread in Multithreading

When a Java program is executed, the `main` method is run by the **main thread**, which is the initial thread created by the JVM. This main thread can spawn additional threads, allowing for multithreaded operations.
