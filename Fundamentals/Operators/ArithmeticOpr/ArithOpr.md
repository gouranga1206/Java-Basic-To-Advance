# Arithmetic Operators in Java

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on variables and values. The primary arithmetic operators in Java include:

- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two operands.
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides the first operand by the second.
- **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.
- **Increment (`++`)**: Increases the value of a variable by 1.
- **Decrement (`--`)**: Decreases the value of a variable by 1.

### Unary Operators: `++` and `--`

- **Increment (`++`)** and **Decrement (`--`)** are **unary operators**, meaning they operate on a single operand.
- These operators are commonly used to increment or decrement a variableâ€™s value by 1.
