# Relational Operators
- Relational operators are used to check the relationship between two operands.
- The relational operators are:
    - Greater than `(>)`
    - Less than `(<)`
    - Greater than or equal to `(>=)`
    - Less than or equal to `(<=)`
    - Equal to `(==)`
    - Not equal to `(!=)`

`Concept of == `
- The **==** operator is used to compare the values of two operands. It returns true if the values are equal, otherwise it returns false.
- means not the memory location but the value stored in the memory location.
