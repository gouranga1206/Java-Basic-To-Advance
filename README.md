## 1. Introduction to Java
- **What is Java?**  
  Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is platform-independent, meaning it can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **History of Java**  
  Java was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has grown to become one of the most popular programming languages for developing web applications, desktop software, and mobile apps.

## 2. Basic Concepts
- **Variables and Data Types**  
  Java supports primitive data types like `int`, `char`, `double`, `boolean`, etc. Variables are used to store data.
  
- **Operators**  
  - Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
  - Assignment Operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
  - Comparison Operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
  - Logical Operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`

- **Control Flow**  
  - Conditional Statements: `if`, `else`, `switch`
  - Looping: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
  
- **Methods**  
  Methods define a block of code that performs a specific task. They can take parameters and return values.

## 3. Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes and Objects**  
  - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of a class.
  - Syntax:
    ```java
    class Car {
      String model;
      int year;
      // Constructor
      Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
      }
    }
    ```

- **Encapsulation**  
  Encapsulation involves hiding the internal state of an object and exposing only necessary details. This is done using **private** variables and **public** getter and setter methods.

- **Inheritance**  
  Inheritance allows one class to inherit the fields and methods of another class, promoting code reuse.

- **Polymorphism**  
  Polymorphism allows an object to take on many forms. It enables one interface to be used for different data types.

- **Abstraction**  
  Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features. This is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

- **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**  
  Interfaces define a contract for classes, while abstract classes provide partial implementations.

## 4. Core Java
- **Arrays and Collections**  
  Arrays store fixed-size data, while collections like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and `HashSet` provide more flexibility in terms of data management.

- **String Handling**  
  The `String` class is used to work with strings in Java. Strings are immutable, meaning once created, they cannot be modified.

- **Exception Handling**  
  Java provides mechanisms to handle runtime errors gracefully using `try-catch` blocks.  
  - Types of exceptions: `Checked Exceptions`, `Unchecked Exceptions`
  - Example:
    ```java
    try {
      int result = 10 / 0;
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    ```

- **File Handling**  
  Java provides classes like `File`, `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, and `BufferedWriter` for reading from and writing to files.

- **Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces**  
  Lambda expressions simplify the creation of anonymous methods in Java. They are used extensively with the `Stream` API and functional interfaces.

## 5. Advanced Java
- **Generics**  
  Java Generics allow you to write classes, interfaces, and methods with type parameters, making them more reusable.

- **Reflection**  
  Reflection allows you to inspect and modify the runtime behavior of your Java application. It provides the ability to examine class structures, methods, and fields dynamically.

- **Annotations**  
  Annotations provide metadata for Java programs. They can be used for documentation, code analysis, or even during runtime.

- **JVM Internals**  
  Understanding the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is critical for performance tuning and debugging. Topics include memory management, garbage collection, and class loading.

---

## 6. Multithreading and Concurrency
- **Multithreading**  
  Java supports multithreading to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. The `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface are commonly used.

- **Synchronization**  
  To avoid thread interference, synchronization ensures that only one thread can access a resource at a time.

- **Executors**  
  The `Executor` framework provides a higher-level replacement for managing threads, allowing you to manage task execution with a pool of threads.

---

## 7. Java Frameworks and Libraries
- **Spring Framework**  
  Spring is a comprehensive framework that simplifies Java development by providing tools for Dependency Injection (DI), Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), and building enterprise-level applications.

- **Hibernate**  
  Hibernate is an object-relational mapping (ORM) tool that simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables.

- **JavaFX**  
  JavaFX is used for building modern user interfaces in Java applications.

- **Apache Maven and Gradle**  
  These are build automation tools that manage project dependencies, build lifecycle, and project configuration.
